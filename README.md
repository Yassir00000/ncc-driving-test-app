## Why I Built This

I was studying for the NCC driving license test using the physical book, but being always on the move made it impossible to carry the study material with me. The book format was really dispersive and inefficient for memorization.

I decided to create this Android app to make learning faster and more interactive. The result? I could study effectively anywhere, with immediate feedback and smart review systems that helped me focus on the areas where I needed more practice.

**The goal was simple:** Transform traditional book study into an engaging, portable, and efficient mobile learning experience.
